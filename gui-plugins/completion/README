# completion-plugin

This plugin enables auto-completion for Pd objects.
Just hit the TAB key while typing into an object to trigger completion mode.
By default, only Pd internals are available, but you can add your own
objects/abstractions names by editing completion.cfg file:
Find the 'user_objects_list'' variable and put there the path to your file.
this file should contain one object name per line (no commas at the end of the
line).
some other options can be tweaked there, it should be pretty straightforward.

Some libraries will automatically get their externals added if they were loaded
with -lib (Gem, gridflow, py, ...).
Their objects list can be found in the subfolder "extra_objects".
