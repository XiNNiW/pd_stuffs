# completion-plugin v-0.42

This plugin enables auto-completion for Pd objects.
Just hit the TAB key while typing into an object to trigger completion mode.

INSTALL:
copy the whole 'completion' folder anywhere in your pd path.

NOTES:
By default, only Pd internals are available, but you can add your own
objects/abstractions names by adding them into any *.txt file inside the
"user_objects" subfolder.
these files should contain one object name per line (no commas at the end of the
line).
some other options can be tweaked in the completion.cfg config file, it should
be pretty straightforward.

Some libraries will automatically get their externals added if they were loaded
with -lib (like Gem, gridflow, ...).
Their objects list can be found in the subfolder "lib_objects".
