# autocompletion-plugin

this plugin enables auto-completion for Pd objects.
just hit the TAB key while typing into an object to cycle through
possible completions.
by default, only Pd internals are available.
you can add your own objects/abstractions names by editing 
autocompletion-plugin.tcl file. find the $::user_objects_list
variable (in the GLOBALS variables) and put there the path to your
file. this file should contain one object name per line (no commas
at the end of the line). if one of your objects name contains
space characters, just put it inside quotes.
