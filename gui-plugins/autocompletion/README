# autocompletion-plugin

This plugin enables auto-completion for Pd objects.
Just hit the TAB key while typing into an object to trigger completion mode.
By default, only Pd internals are available, but you can add your own
objects/abstractions names by editing autocompletion-plugin.tcl file:
Find the $::user_objects_list variable (in the GLOBALS variables) and put there
the path to your file. this file should contain one object name per line (no
commas at the end of the line). if one of your objects name contains space
characters, just put it inside quotes.
