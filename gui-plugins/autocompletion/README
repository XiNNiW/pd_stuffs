# autocompletion-plugin

this plugin enables auto-completion for Pd objects.
just hit the TAB key while typing into an object to cycle through
possible completions.
by default, only Pd internals are available.
you can add your own objects/abstractions names by editing 
autocompletion-plugin.tcl file. find the $::user_objects_list variable (in the 
GLOBALS variables) and put there the path to your file. this file should contain
one object name per line (no commas at the end of the line). if one of your
objects name contains a space character, just put it inside (double) quotes.
